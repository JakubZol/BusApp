# BusApp
AngularJS web app for searching bus connections and timetable.
Purpose of this project is to improve my AngularJS knowledge and skills, not creating full operational web application, that is why it contains no backhand site. Every operation is performed on user's site in Javascript code.

UPDATE.: Added Java backend using Jersey framework and PostgreSQL database. Currently there are problems with passing json responses to client site thus frontend is using static mockdata stored in json files. Both backend and frontend are still under development.
